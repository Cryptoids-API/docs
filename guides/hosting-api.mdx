## Get API script

[Follow vide tutorial](https://youtu.be/Gfdb_1lq9kg)

After completion of order you will receive a PHP script, which contains codes that's return **TOTAL** and **CIRCULATING** supply of your token.

Login to your hosting file manager, you can you any hosting that support PHP.
I'm using [Hostinger](https://hostinger.in?REFERRALCODE=1SANJITHACK71) in my case to deploy API script.

Follow instructions shown in the image. In future UI may be changed.

![Hosting File Manager](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/kf7zknrwwyemvwbbzrdl)_*Hostinger File Manager*_

- Click on `File Manager` highlighted red color.
- It will redirect you to your website `File Manager`

![Public HTML Folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/hlyvjhkjtfdr9dblmdi9)_*Hostinger Public HTML*_

- There will be a folder named `pulic_html` , open that folder.
- Now you are at root of your website.
- We need to create a folder or directory for our PHP API code.
- In my case I have created folder named `/api`
- Follow below instructions to create folder

![Create folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/kgxktpr3mmyztjaphzlf)_*Hostinger create new Folder*_

- Click on `New Folder` highlighted in red color.
- A new popup will appear.

![Creatting Folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/mkc8hu7gef0xtlgdaw9p)_*Creating Folder*_

- Click on `CREATE` highlighted in red.
- Now you will be inside `/api` folder, if not then open the folder you have created.
- Then we need to upload the API script, to upload you need to click the the upside arrow on right-top on your file manager.
- Follow image instructions

![Select upload file](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/qyr0cq96d0pm9tcethpk)_*Select upload file*_

- Locate API script where you have downloaded and saved from Fiverr.

![script select](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/mgpymhs1ytsxjkw5s5ow)_*Select script to upload*_

![Script uploaded](https://res.cloudinary.com/daa6vklnq/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/upoald/crbgqpln6u1atbhyjlp5)_*Script has been uploaded*_

- `Kaboom!` you have just successfully deployed your API script on your hosting.
- Now we need to find out our endpoint which returns, `TOTAL` and `CIRCULATING` supply.
- Let's take an example. If your website domain is:

```
https://example.com/
```

- And the folder you created previously was `/api` then, you can call API by:

```
https://example.com/api
```

- If you see it returns a message in `JSON` formate something like this:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "contractAddress": "0x796a4503b444a71b331c9556bef0815237ddeabc",
  "decimal": 18,
  "symbol": "oDOGE"
}
```

- To access `TOTAL` and `CIRCULATING` supply API endpoint, we will pass a query parameter named `q` in this way, here is the available query

| Query       | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxcoins    | It returns the maximum supply of token without burn             |
| totalcoins  | It returns total supply of your token with burn or without burn |
| circulating | It returns the circulating supply of your token                 |

- API endpoint for `TOTAL SUPPLY`:

```
https://example.com/api/?q=totalcoins
```

- API endpoint for `CIRCULATING SUPPLY`:

```
https://example.com/api/?q=circulating
```

## How token supply are calculated?

According to [Coinmarketcap's documentation](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043396252-Supply-Circulating-Total-Max-)

- `Max supply`: Is the number of maximum token
- `Total supply`: Max supply - burn tokens
- `Circulating supply`: Total supply - (Wallet hold by team/developers)

We tried our best to describe set-up process. If you have any query please feel free to ask:
